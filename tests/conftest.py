"""Suite-wide guard: no test may leave a subprocess behind.

This suite starts real processes on purpose — backend MCP servers, and the daemon itself —
because a mock proves nothing about a subprocess's lifetime, and owning subprocesses is
this project's entire job. The cost is that forgetting to reap one is **completely
silent**. Nothing raises, no timeout fires, and the tests pass.

CPython 3.11 does mention it, once, as a `PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` from
`BaseSubprocessTransport.__del__` running after its event loop closed, which is why that
warning is an error here (see `filterwarnings` in `pyproject.toml`). But it is **not a
reliable detector**, and this file exists because of that:

* It fires only when the garbage collector happens to finalize the transport during a
  later test, so a real leak can pass a whole run unreported.
* When it does fire it names **whichever test was running at the time**, which is almost
  never the test that leaked. Chasing that name is chasing noise.
* Only 3.11 emits it at all. On 3.14 the same leak is entirely invisible — and since the
  floor moved to 3.12, **no interpreter CI runs emits it any more**. That does not weaken
  this guard, it is the reason for it: the warning was never the detector, and the last
  version that produced it leaving the matrix only removes a signal that was already
  unreliable. `filterwarnings` keeps it an error for anyone still running 3.11 locally.

So the check here is deterministic instead: wrap `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`, keep a
**strong** reference to every process it returns, and at the end of the session fail if
any of their transports were never closed — naming the test that created each one.

The reference has to be strong. A weak one is collected exactly in the case that leaks,
which is how the first attempt at this reported "0 unclosed" while the warning was still
firing. Holding them also means nothing is finalized mid-run, so this guard *replaces* the
warning as the detector rather than supplementing it — if this file is ever removed, the
leaks come back silently.

## Finding the leak once this fails

The failure names the creating test. From there the cause is usually one of:

1. **A harness that built a `Backend` or a `Supervisor` and never called `stop()` /
   `close_all()`.** The daemon does this in a `finally`; a test has to do it too.
2. **A test that asserts on a *failed* start.** `Backend.start` tears its own client down
   on every failure path, but a test that constructs an `MCPStdioClient` directly to
   exercise one of those paths owns the teardown itself.
3. **A backend whose shutdown ladder was interrupted.** `MOCK_IGNORE_SIGTERM` exists to
   exercise the SIGKILL escalation, and a test that cancels partway through leaves the
   child alive.
