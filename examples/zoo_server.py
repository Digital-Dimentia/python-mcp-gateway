"""The schema zoo: an MCP server that exists to be rendered, not to be useful.

**Vendored** from `tests/fixtures/mock_mcp_server.py` in
https://github.com/Digital-Dimentia/python-acp (Apache-2.0, same author) at `c6624f4`,
verbatim apart from this header and `zoo-prompt-animal`, which was added here. Pure stdlib, no dependencies, stdio like any other
backend.

With `MOCK_MCP_SCHEMA_ZOO=1` -- which `servers.dev.yaml` sets, because `env_mode: curated`
means this child inherits nothing the file does not name -- it publishes thirteen tools,
five prompts, seven resources and two URI templates. One per construct rather than one
kitchen sink, so a renderer that gets one wrong fails visibly on that one:

    zoo-types      every JSON type bare, plus an untyped and a union-typed property
    zoo-strings    minLength/maxLength, pattern, and six formats including a made-up one
    zoo-numbers    inclusive and exclusive bounds, multipleOf, and an unbounded integer
    zoo-choices    enum, enum+enumNames, oneOf/const, a bare const, and a non-string enum
    zoo-arrays     arrays of scalars, of enums (a multi-select), of objects, and of nothing
    zoo-required   required against optional against defaulted, plus dependentRequired
    zoo-nested     objects inside objects, two deep
    zoo-empty      `properties: {}` -- a statement that it takes none
    zoo-silent     no inputSchema at all -- a claim about nothing

    zoo-if-then-else, zoo-dependent-schemas, zoo-all-of, zoo-one-of
                   the four a form is expected to DECLINE, each on its own so each
                   fallback can be looked at separately

Every tool echoes its arguments back as JSON, which is the round trip worth having: the
types that came out the far end are visible rather than assumed, so `--count 3` arriving
as `3` rather than `"3"` is a thing you can see.

`zoo://ticks` is the one resource that is not a constant -- each read appends a
minute-stamped line and keeps the last ten -- so reading it twice proves the second read
reached the server rather than a cache. `zoo-blob` is base64 that a renderer must never
print. See `src/mcp_gateway/ui/render.js` for both.

Run it through the gateway: `make run-dev`.
