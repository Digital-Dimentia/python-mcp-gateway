"""Build and export the python-mcp-gateway container image.

The Makefile calls this instead of inlining the logic in a recipe, for the same
reason ``scripts/venv_bootstrap.py`` exists: the rules are conditional in ways
``make`` expresses badly, and a recipe cannot be tested.

The condition that matters is that *finding* a container engine is not the same
as being able to *use* one. The old recipe guarded with ``command -v podman ||
command -v docker`` and treated a hit as "an engine is available". That is wrong
in two common situations:

* podman on macOS is a client for a Linux VM. The binary is on ``PATH`` and
  runs, but every build fails if the VM is stopped or its socket is
  unreachable. On the development machine the sandbox cannot dial the VM's
  loopback SSH port at all, so ``command -v`` succeeds and the build then dies
  with exit 125.
* ``docker`` is on ``PATH`` on any machine that once installed Docker Desktop,
  whether or not the daemon is running.

So this script probes the engine (``<engine> version``, which contacts the
server and is non-zero when it cannot) rather than trusting ``PATH``, and
reports three distinct outcomes instead of two: no engine installed, an engine
that is installed but unreachable, and an engine that is ready.

Both "no engine" and "unreachable" *skip* by default, so packaging works on a
machine without a usable engine. ``--require`` turns any skip into a hard
error; the release workflow passes it, because a release that silently ships
without its container image is the failure this script exists to prevent.

The other half of that failure is subtler. The old recipe joined build and save
with ``;``, so ``save`` ran even after ``build`` failed -- and a machine holding
a ``python-mcp-gateway:local`` from an earlier run would save *that* image and exit 0,
packaging a stale container as though it were current. Here the output file is
deleted before the build, and the save runs only if the build succeeded, so a
failed build leaves no tar for ``package``/``release-bundle`` to pick up.

Multi-platform builds take a different path per engine, which is why the engine
*kind* matters and not just its path: ``docker`` needs ``buildx`` and emits an
OCI archive directly, while ``podman`` builds into a manifest list and then
pushes that to an archive. Plain ``docker build`` cannot produce a multi-platform
image at all, so choosing the wrong verb fails rather than silently producing a
single-arch image -- which would be the worse outcome, since a single-arch image
looks entirely correct until someone runs it on a Pi.

Every mode is stdlib-only and safe to run with any interpreter >= 3.11.
