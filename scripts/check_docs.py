"""Check the documentation invariants nothing else enforces.

Three of them, and none is caught by ruff, pytest, or a human skimming a diff:

1. **Every relative Markdown link resolves.** A doc that links to a module doc that was
   renamed or deleted reads as authoritative and is wrong, which is worse than silence.
2. **Every Mermaid flowchart edge names a node the same block defines**, and no node is
   defined twice. GitHub renders a diagram with a dangling edge by inventing a bare node,
   so the failure is a *plausible-looking picture*, not an error — the worst kind.
3. **Every production module under `src/mcp_gateway/` has a sibling `.md`, and every
   sibling `.md` has a module.** The repo's co-located doc rule (`docs/full-apc-plan.md`
   step 8.3), which until now lived only in the `repo-docs-sync` skill.

Exits non-zero with a list. Run it from the repository root: `make docs-check`.

**What it deliberately does not do.** It does not render Mermaid — that needs node and a
headless browser, which is a large dependency for a small check — and it does not follow
`#anchors`, because heading slugs are a GitHub implementation detail and pinning them
would produce false failures on every heading rename. See `pyacp-6ni.5`.
